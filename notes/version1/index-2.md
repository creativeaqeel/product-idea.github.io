# Documentation on Grocery App 
## Part-2

- Previous documentation will be the same.

## Requirements:

### First screen after opening the app

- Logo and name animation (1 -3 sec)

### Second screen after opening the app

- 2-3 welcome sliding notes where the app welcomes the user and discusses the app and its benefits.

### Third screen after opening the app

- The user has to enter a username and password and a submit button to log in to his previous account (You can check the sketch file attached with the documentation.)
- for new users (user will have to enter their full name, username, mobile number, location area, email ID, password, confirm password and a register button)
- Forget Password Page: username, mobile number/email ID (to get verification code), new password, confirm password.

### Fourth screen after opening the app

- have to discuss it, and it will be updated in upcoming documentation. 

### Questions:
- What if a child opens an account? Then, will he be considered an admin?
- He invited their parents to join as customers, and then obviously, the app will consider the child as an admin/parent in the app. Hence, it means(according to our previous discussion) the admin will have to approve the order(the child), which will not be a good sign. 
- can the admin add more than one family member to join and place orders?
- if I go with (admin add 3-4 family members), any of all customers place an order, then whose location the app will consider to tell the store that your customer is nearby or simply if two customers will be nearby the store, then whose location will be preferred for the order or both locations will be shown in the app for the utility store (that will make confusion for the store)
